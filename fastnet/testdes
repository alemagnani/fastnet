4 test adaptive learning rate with 0.01 relu neuron, the learning rate factor [1.05, 0.95, 0.9, 0.85]
5 test with 0.01 relu normal trainer
6 test with relu normal trainer test freq = 10
7 test with relu adaptive learning rate trainer, test freq = 10, factor = [0.95, 0.9, 0.85, 0.8]
8 compare to test 7, using the different data as train and test data
9 compare to test 7, after 30 iteration to adjust
10 run normal trainer 50 epoches, see how far it can go
11 run adaptive learning rate trainer, 40 iteration, factor [1.05, 0.95, 0.9, 0.85, 0.8]
12 run adaptive learning rate trainer, 40 iteration, factor [1.05, 0.95, 0.9, 0.85, 0.8] with 1.28 learning rate scale
13 run normal trainer, with 1.28 learning rate scale and 512 batch size
14 run normal trainer, with 1.28 learning rate scale and 256 batch size
15 run normal trainer, with 1.28 learning rate scale and 256 batch size, 70 epochs
16 run adaptive learning rate trainer when increment is larger than 5%, with 1.28 learning rate scale and 128 batch size, 70 epochs, factor [1.05, 0.95, 0.9, 0.85, 0.8]
17 run adaptive learning rate trainer when increment is larger than 2.5%, with 1.28 learning rate scale and 128 batch size, 70 epochs, factor [1.05, 0.95, 0.9, 0.85, 0.8]
18 run adaptive learning rate trainer when increment is larger than 2.5%, with 1 learning rate scale and 128 batch size, 30 epochs, factor [1.5, 1.2, 0.8, 0.66]
19 compare to 18, the initial learning rate is 1.28
20 compare to 19, the initial learning rate is 2
